## Some Web Apps

I'm not calling these 'portfolio' since these doesn't seems to be so impressive.

- [img.mowl.cc](https://img.mowl.cc/) (An image converting web tool powered by wasm-vips)
- [app.mxowl.com](https://app.mxowl.com/) (An old example PWA created for fun)

## Other Things

There are also some projects that are not opened to the public (yet), mostly because these are for personal use only.

Let me know if you want some of these to have a published version.

- (Node.js) Telegram notification bot for FurAffinity, support all six types of notifications on the nav bar.
  - A copy of the notification detail will be stored locally (SQLite) and send along with the notification message.
- (Node.js) QQ bot for analysing and notify improper contents in groups, with some simple interactions (send stickers, paint [congratulations post](https://witnessbot.mxowl.com/services/congratulations/) etc.).
  - Currently based on [mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai). Planning to migrate to [OICQ](https://github.com/takayama-lily/oicq).
